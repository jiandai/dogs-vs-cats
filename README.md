## Exercise on transfer learning I (5/11/17)
- Take dogs-vs-cats Kaggle dataset
- Use pretrained Xception to predict ImageNet label
- Use an online lookup to translate Imagenet label to dogs-vs-cats classification

## Exercise on transfer learning II (5/21/17)
- Use VGG16 to predict bottle neck features
- Test different input image size
